# When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iyerate multiple times through different models. True/Falise?
False<br>
# sigmold/ tanh/ leaky ReLU/ ReLU
# Images for cat recognition is an example of "Structured" data, because it is represented as a structured array in a compuer. True/False?
False
# A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of "unstructured" data beacause it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?
False
# Why is an RNN used for machine translation, say translating English to French?
